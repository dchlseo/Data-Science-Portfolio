Data has been an integral ingredient in formulating my viewpoint on the world. It not only authenticated theories, but enriched my perspective on the world by suggesting alternative viewpoints and possibilities that may not have occurred to me had I only been engulfed in my own intuition.   

This repository is a collection of personal data science projects that I have worked on or am currently working on. It includes a wide range of applications and techniques in data science, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced machine learning models.

Each project directory contains details about the project, including datasets used, methodologies, code, and findings.
