Data has been an integral ingredient in formulating my viewpoint on the world. It not only authenticates theories but also enriches my perspective by suggesting alternative viewpoints and possibilities. These are insights that might not have occurred to me had I relied solely on my intuition. 

This repository is a collection of personal data science projects that I have worked on or am currently working on. It includes a wide range of applications and techniques in data science, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to advanced machine learning models.

Each project directory contains details about the project, including datasets used, methodologies, code, and findings.

Also, the notebook files are written using both Korean and English.
