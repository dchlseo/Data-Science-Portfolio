# World Terrorism Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of global terrorism data. The primary goal is to understand the trends, patterns, and impacts of terrorist activities worldwide. The analysis covers various aspects, including the frequency of attacks over the years, the countries most affected, the types of attacks, and the casualties resulting from these incidents.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: [Terrorism Around the World](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ash316/terrorism-around-the-world). It includes detailed records of terrorist activities from 1970 to 2017.

## Key Features of the Analysis

- **Data Selection**: From the extensive dataset, 21 key variables were chosen to provide a macro view of global terrorism trends.
- **Yearly Trends**: Analysis of the number of terrorist incidents per year to identify patterns and spikes in activities.
- **Geographical Focus**: Identification of the top 10 countries most affected by terrorism and analysis of regional differences in terrorism.
- **Casualty Analysis**: Examination of the number of deaths and injuries resulting from terrorist attacks, both globally and in specific countries.
- **Attack Types**: Exploration of the various methods of attacks used by terrorists.
- **Decade-wise Analysis**: A look into how terrorism has evolved over the decades from the 1970s to the 2010s.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating static plots and visualizations.
- **Plotly**: For interactive plots.
- **Folium**: For mapping terrorist activities geographically.
- **WordCloud**: To visualize the most prominent terrorist groups.

## Key Findings

- A significant increase in terrorist activities post-2011, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, and South Asia.
